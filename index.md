# Muhammed Yaseen Nivas

Welcome to my website! I am a high-school senior interested in olympiad biology, physics (and the math that comes with it). I like creating handouts on topics that I've learned. 

# Handouts

Even though I'm better at biology, most of my handouts/notes are on physics/math because reading bio textbooks are much better (and efficient) than reading
handouts in my opinion. Nevertheless, here are some of my works.

## Math Club
I run (along with a few other students) the school math club (named Euler's Etudiants). I've taken a couple lectures on extracurricular topics such as modular arithmetic, vieta's relations and the likes.
